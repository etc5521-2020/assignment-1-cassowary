The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) revealed that TIM was fined due to numerous unlawful data processing activities related to marketing and advertising, which included unsolicited promotional calls and prize competitions in which data subjects were entered without consent.One of the reasons for the large fine was the fact that the unlawful data processing activities involved several million individuals. One individual, for example, was called a total of 155 times in a month while TIM refused to add the affected individual on a no-call list even after several requests. The DPA determined that the company lacked control over the call centers and did not have adequate measures to add people to no-call lists.TIM also did not provide accurate and detailed enough privacy policies and data processing policies, and as such consumers were not efficiently informed about the data collected and processed. The company&#8217;s management of data breaches was also not efficient according to Garante.Besides the fine, Garante also imposed 20 corrective measures according to Art. 58(2) GDPR which prohibits TIM from processing marketing-related data of those individuals who have refused to receive promotional calls, individuals who asked to be blacklisted and individuals who are not clients of TIM.The company was also forbidden from using customer data collected from the &#8220;My Tim&#8221;, &#8220;Tim Personal&#8221; and &#8220;Tim Smart Kid&#8221; apps.

Facebook argued that it did in fact appoint a data protection officer in Ireland who acted as a data protection officer for all the local European Facebook branches. The Data Protection Authority of Hamburg, however, argued that Facebook did not notify the German authority about this appointment, and as such, the fine is valid. The reason the fine was relatively small was that Facebook did, after all, appoint a DPO but failed to notify German authorities.

The Authority also questioned Google&#8217;s practice of informing website owners about which search results Google had removed, specifically which link (search result) has been removed and who was behind the removal request.

The NAIH determined that the data controller can’t rely on the performance of the credit contract or the consent of the data subjects for the data processing since the data subjects had concluded this contract with the bank, not with the data controller. Thus, the data controller has no legal basis for the data processing.

However, the data controller processed his contact data to pursue an enforcement claim concluding that it had a legitimate interest and reason. The NAIH determined that the controller had no legitimate reason to process the data subject’s telephone number, since the address was also accessible, which was enough for the completion of enforcement initiatives.

In support of his claims, he brought forth a list containing the membership fees related to multiple members of the Association in Pest county. NAIH determined that the Budapest Environs Regional Court could only process this data for the purpose of payroll management and deduction. Therefore, in this case, the Court had no legal basis for the data processing and disclosure to other persons.

While the employer argued that CCTV monitoring was required to assess the work performance of the employee and provide protection of the surveillance system, the NAIH argued back. The data processing authority argued that CCTV monitoring wasn’t appropriate to assess the work performance and the employer had no legal basis to do so. Moreover, to protect the public area surveillance system, the employer could have used other methods that didn’t invade the employee’s private space.

The employer suspended the employee’s account, leaving no time for the employee to copy or delete his private information (telephone number and messages). The NAIH stated that the employer is obligated to issue a privacy notice to the employee related to the reasons for the monitoring (such as business continuity, internal investigation, and disciplinary purposes). Moreover, the employer should prepare a balancing test to demonstrate the legitimacy of their monitoring purposes.

The employee had no time to copy or delete any personal data included in the former inbox. The NAIH mentions that, in such a case where an employer accesses the employee’s data, the employee or a representative of the employee should be present, even in the case where the employment is terminated. Moreover, the employee has the right to demand a copy or the deletion of the private data. Simultaneously, the employer is obligated to record the access with minutes and photos when the employee is not present. Last but not least, the employer must adopt the necessary internal policies on the archiving and use of relevant IT devices and e-mail accounts.

The picture was uploaded to Facebook by the representative. While the child’s face was blurred, the representative hinted that it was the director’s daughter. In turn, the director complained that he did not agree or consent to the taking of this photo. NAIH deemed the act of the director to be non-public. Moreover, the photo did not conclusively prove that the director was tearing off the poster.

The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) revealed that TIM was fined due to numerous unlawful data processing activities related to marketing and advertising, which included unsolicited promotional calls and prize competitions in which data subjects were entered without consent.One of the reasons for the large fine was the fact that the unlawful data processing activities involved several million individuals. One individual, for example, was called a total of 155 times in a month while TIM refused to add the affected individual on a no-call list even after several requests. The DPA determined that the company lacked control over the call centers and did not have adequate measures to add people to no-call lists.TIM also did not provide accurate and detailed enough privacy policies and data processing policies, and as such consumers were not efficiently informed about the data collected and processed. The company&#8217;s management of data breaches was also not efficient according to Garante.Besides the fine, Garante also imposed 20 corrective measures according to Art. 58(2) GDPR which prohibits TIM from processing marketing-related data of those individuals who have refused to receive promotional calls, individuals who asked to be blacklisted and individuals who are not clients of TIM.The company was also forbidden from using customer data collected from the &#8220;My Tim&#8221;, &#8220;Tim Personal&#8221; and &#8220;Tim Smart Kid&#8221; apps.

The Data Protection Authority of Hamburg, however, argued that Facebook did not notify the German authority about this appointment, and as such, the fine is valid. The reason the fine was relatively small was that Facebook did, after all, appoint a DPO but failed to notify German authorities. The fine was given to Facebook Germany GmbH, which is the local German branch of the company.The fine was issued sometimes in 2019 but was only made public by the Data Protection Authority of Hamburg in February 2020. The exact date of the fine was not revealed.

The Data Protection Authority of Sweden had already completed an investigation on Google in 2017 where it investigated how the company dealt with individuals&#8217; requests to be removed from search results. At that time, the Data Protection Authority instructed Google to be more pro-active in executing these removal requests. In 2018 the Authority initialed a further investigation after it was reported that Google did not remove search results related to individuals even after the earlier instructions in 2017 to do so. The Authority also questioned Google&#8217;s practice of informing website owners about which search results Google had removed, specifically which link (search result) has been removed and who was behind the removal request.

In this sense, the bank went ahead and argued that its decision was the right one since the documentation would be related to repaid loans, which a customer shouldn&#8217;t have the right to access. A data subject alerted the DPA, which demanded that the bank provide copies of the loan documentation to the data subject.

The financial enterprise said that it had sold the client’s claim stemming from the contract to a third party, which means the data transfer was necessary. However, the Hungarian data processing authority claimed the financial institution had sold the client’s claim and transferred the relevant data after the non-fulfillment of the relevant contract by the client. Therefore, the financial institution couldn’t rely on the performance of the contract with the client.

Moreover, the director was accompanied by his child. The local representative posted the picture on Facebook and, even though he blurred the child’s face, he alluded the child to be the daughter of the director. When the photo was taken, the company director told the representative that he does not consent to the photo being taken. NAIH concluded that the photo doesn’t directly prove that the director ripped off an election poster, and even that was not a public act. The Data Protection Authority also claimed that only the name of the director was public information and nothing else.
